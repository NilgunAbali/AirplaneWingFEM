# AirplaneWingFEM
Modelled an airplane wing under lift force using the principles of symmetry within the wing geometry. Compared different structural modifications to strengthen the wing structure and yield the least amount of displacements. Then compared different methods of attaching L shaped stiffeners to the wing skin, naming 'tie' and 'merged' options.
